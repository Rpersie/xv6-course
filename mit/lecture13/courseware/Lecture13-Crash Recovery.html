<body><p>6.828 2014 Lecture 13: Crash Recovery, Logging
=

</p>
<p>Plan
  homework
  problem: crash recovery
    crash leads to inconsistent on-disk file system
    on-disk data structure has "dangling" pointers
  solutions:
    synchronous write
    logging

</p>
<p>Last xv6 lecture
  next week switch to papers
  quiz next week

</p>
<p>Homework
  draw picture inode, double indirect, indirect, block

</p>
<h1>Why crash recovery</h1>
<p>What is crash recovery?
  you're writing the file system
  then the power fails
  you reboot
  is your file system still useable?

</p>
<p>the main problem:
  crash during multi-step operation
  leaves FS invariants violated
  can lead to ugly FS corruption

</p>
<p>examples:
  create:
    new dirent
    allocate file inode
    crash: dirent points to free inode -- disaster!
    crash: inode not free but not used -- not so bad
  write:
    block content
    inode addrs[] and len
    indirect block
    block free bitmap
    crash: inode refers to free block -- disaster!
    crash: block not free but not used -- not so bad
  unlink:
    block free bitmaps
    free inode
    erase dirent

</p>
<p>what can we hope for?
  after rebooting and running recovery code
  1. FS internal invariants maintained
     e.g., no block is both in free list and in a file
  2. all but last few operations preserved on disk
     e.g., data I wrote yesterday are preserved
     user might have to check last few operations
  3. no order anomalies
     echo 99 &gt; result ; echo done &gt; status

</p>
<p>simplifying assumption: disk is fail-stop
  disk executes the writes FS sends it, and does nothing else
    perhaps doesn't perform the very last write
  thus:
    no wild writes
    no decay of sectors

</p>
<p>correctness and performance often conflict
  safety =&gt; write to disk ASAP
  speed =&gt; don't write the disk (batch, write-back cache, sort by track, &amp;c)

</p>
<p>we'll discuss two approaches:
  synchronous meta-data update + fsck
  logging (xv6 and linux ext3)

</p>
<h1>Synchronous-write solution</h1>
<p>synchronous meta-data update
  an old approach to crash recovery
  simple, slow, incomplete

</p>
<p>most problem cases look like dangling references
  inode -&gt; free block
  dirent -&gt; free inode

</p>
<p>idea: always initialize <em>on disk</em> before creating reference
  implement by doing the initialization write,
  waiting for it to complete,
  and only then doing the referencing write
  "synchronous writes"

</p>
<p>example: file creation
  what's the right order of synchronous writes?
  1. mark inode as allocated
  2. create directory entry

</p>
<p>example: file deletion
  1. erase directory entry
  2. erase inode addrs[], mark as free
  3. mark blocks free

</p>
<p>example: rename() (not in xv6)
  between directories, i.e. mv d1/x d2/y
  1. create new dirent
  2. erase old dirent
  or the other way around?
  probably safest to create then erase!

</p>
<p>what will be true after crash+reboot?
  all completed sys calls guaranteed visible on disk
  reachable part of FS will be mostly correct
    except interrupted rename leaves file in both directories!
  blocks and inodes may be unreferenced but not marked free

</p>
<p>so: sync meta-data update system needs to check at reboot
  to free unreferenced inodes and blocks
  descend dir tree from root, remembering all i-numbers and block #s seen
  mark everthing else free
  probably have to punt on interrupted rename()

</p>
<p>many kinds of UNIX used sync writes until 10 years ago

</p>
<p>problems with synchronous meta-data update
  very slow during normal operation
  very slow during recovery

</p>
<p>how long would fsck take?
  a read from a random place on disk takes about 10 milliseconds
  descending the directory hierarchy might involve a random read per inode
  so maybe (n-inodes / 100) seconds?
  faster if you read all inodes (and dir blocks) sequentially,
    then descend hierarchy in memory
  my server: fsck takes 10 minutes per 70GB disk w/ 2 million inodes
    clearly reading many inodes sequentially, not seeking
    still a long time, probably linear in disk size

</p>
<p>ordinary performance of sync meta-data update?
  creating a file and writing a few bytes takes 8 writes, probably 80 ms
    (ialloc, init inode, write dirent, alloc data block, add to inode,
     write data, set length in inode, one other mystery write to data)
  so can create only about a dozen small files per second!
  think about un-tar or rm *

</p>
<p>how to get better performance?
  RAM is cheap
  disk sequential throughput is high, 50 MB/sec
  (maybe someday solid state disks will change the landscape)
  we'll talk about big memory, then sequential disk throughput

</p>
<p>why not use a big write-back disk cache?
  <em>no</em> sync meta-data update
  operations <em>only</em> modify in-memory disk cache (no disk write)
    so creat(), unlink(), write() &amp;c return almost immediately
  bufs written to disk later
    if cache is full, write LRU dirty block
    write all dirty blocks every 30 seconds, to limit loss if crash
  this is how old Linux EXT2 file system worked

</p>
<p>would write-back cache improve performance? why, exactly?
  after all, you have to write the disk in the end anyway

</p>
<p>what can go wrong w/ write-back cache?
  example: unlink() followed by create()
    an existing file x with some content, all safely on disk
    one user runs unlink(x)
      1. delete x's dir entry <strong>
      2. put blocks in free bitmap
      3. mark x's inode free
    another user then runs create(y)
      4. allocate a free inode
      5. initialize the inode to be in-use and zero-length
      6. create y's directory entry </strong>
    again, all writes initially just to disk buffer cache
    suppose only ** writes forced to disk, then crash
    what is the problem?
    can fsck detect and fix this?

</p>
<h1>Logging solution</h1>
<p>how can we get both speed and safety?
  write only to cache
  somehow remember relationships among writes
    e.g. don't send #1 to disk w/o #2 and #3

</p>
<p>most popular solution: logging (== journaling)
  goal: atomic system calls w.r.t. crashes
  goal: fast recovery (no hour-long fsck)
  goal: speed of write-back cache for normal operations

</p>
<p>will introduce logging in two steps
  first xv6's log, which only provides safety
  then Linux EXT3, which is also fast

</p>
<p>the basic idea behind logging
  you want atomicity: all of a system call's writes, or none
    let's call an atomic operation a "transaction"
  record all writes the sys call <em>will</em> do in the log
  then record "done"
  then do the writes
  on crash+recovery:
    if "done" in log, replay all writes in log
    if no "done", ignore log
  this is a WRITE-AHEAD LOG

</p>
<p>xv6's simple logging
  [diagram: buffer cache, FS tree on disk, log on disk]
  FS has a log on disk
  syscall:
    begin_op()
      bp = bread()
      bp-&gt;data[] = ...
      log_write(bp)
      more writes ...
    end_op()
  begin_op():
    need to indicate which group of writes must be atomic!
    need to check if log is being committed
    need to check if our writes will fit in log
  log_write():
    record sector # in in-memory log
    don't append buffer sector content to log, but leave in buffer cache
    Q: why is this save? will block be evicted from cache?
  end_op():
    if no outstanding operations, commit
  commit():
    put in-memory log onto disk
      copy data from buffer cache into log
    record "done" and sector #s in log
    install writes from log into home location
      second disk write
    erase "done" from log
  recovery:
    if log says "done":
      copy blocks from log to real locations on disk

</p>
<p>what is good about this design?
  correctness due to write-ahead log
  good disk throughput: log naturally batches writes
    but data disk blocks are written twice
  what about concurrency?

</p>
<p>simple design: no concurrency
  must serialize transactions
  easy solution:
    acquire a global lock in begin_op()
    release that global lock in end_op()
  serializes transactions but system calls too

</p>
<p>challenges in allowing concurrent system calls:
  must allow writes from several calls to be in log
  on commit must write them all
    to maintain order between sys calls
  BUT cannot write data from calls still in a transaction

</p>
<p>xv6 solution
  install log when no systems calls are in a transaction
  count number of calls in system calls
  allow no new system calls to start if their data might not fit in log
    we computed an upperbound of number of blocks each calls writes
    if sys call doesn't fit, block its thread and wait until log has been installed
    (nice that each user-level thread has its own kernel thread)
    some sys calls may be broken in several transactions (e.g., write)

</p>
<p>let's look at the code:
  filewrite
    compute how max blocks we can write before log is full
    begin_op before ilock to avoid deadlock
    write that max blocks in a transaction
      log_write()
      will set B_DIRTY, so that block won't be evicted
        see bio.c
      Q: would it be bad if block is evicted?
    end_op after max blocks
      if outstanding = 0, commit()
    commit():
      put writes into log
      write_head
      install_trans
        ide.c will clear B_DIRTY for block written --- now it can be evicted
      write_head
  recover_from_log

</p>
<p>how to set MAXOPBLOCKS and LOGSIZE?
  MAXOPBLOCK = 10
    create
  LOGSIZE = 3 * MAXOPBLOCKS
    some concurrency

</p>
<p>what needs to be wrapped in transactions?
  many obvious examples (e.g., example above)
  but also less obvious ones:
    iput() 
    namei()
  =&gt; everything that might update disk

</p>
<p>concrete example why iput() should be wrapped:
 don't wrap iput in sys_chdir()
 $ mkdir abc
 $ cd abc
 $ ../rm ../abc
 $ cd ..
 It will cause a panic("write outside of trans");
 iput() might write when refcnt becomes 0 

</p>
<p>what's wrong with xv6's logging?
  log traffic will be huge: every operation is many records
  logs whole blocks even if only a few bytes written
    worse, xv6 reads a block from disk even when it will be overwritten completely
  each block in log is written synchronously in write_log()
    could give write them as a batch and only write head synchronously 
  eager write to real location -- slow
    could delay writes until log must be flushed (i.e, group commit)
  every block written twice
  trouble with operations that don't fit in the log
    unlink might dirty many blocks while truncating file
