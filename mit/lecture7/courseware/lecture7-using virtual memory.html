<body><p>6.828 2014 Lecture 7: using virtual memory
==

</p>
<ul>
<li><p>plan: cool things you can do with vm</p>
<ul>
<li>kernel tricks (e.g., one zero-filled page)</li>
<li>faster system calls (e.g., copy-on-write fork)</li>
<li>new features (e.g., memory-mapped files)</li>
<li>JOS and VM</li>
<li>ideas for last lab (final project)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>virtual memory: several views</p>
<ul>
<li>primary purpose: isolation
each process has its own address space</li>
<li>Virtual memory provides a level-of-indirection
provides kernel with opportunity to do cool stuff</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>lazy/on-demand page allocation</p>
<ul>
<li>sbrk() is old fashioned;
it asks application to "predict" how much memory they need
difficult for applications to predict how much memory they need in advance
sbrk allocates memory that may never be used.</li>
<li>moderns OSes allocate memory lazily
allocate physical memory when application needs it</li>
<li>HW solution<!---
  draw xv6 user-part of address space 
  demo solution; breakpoint right before mappages in trap.c
  explain page faults
-->
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>share kernel page tables in xv6</p>
<ul>
<li>observation:
kvmalloc() allocates new pages for kernel page table for each process
but all processes have the same kernel page table</li>
<li>idea: modify kvmalloc()/freevm() to share kernel page table<!---
  demo HWKVM
-->
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>guard page to protect against stack overflow</p>
<ul>
<li>put a non-mapped page below user stack
if stack overflows, application will see page fault</li>
<li>allocate more stack when application runs off stack into guard page <!---
  draw xv6 user-part of address space 
  demo stackoverflow 
  set breakpoint at g
  run stackoverflow
  look at $esp
  look at pg info at qemu console
  note page has no U bit
-->
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>one zero-filled page</p>
<ul>
<li>kernel often fills a page with zeros</li>
<li>idea: memset <em>one</em> page with zeros
map that page copy-on-write when kernel needs zero-filled page
on write make copy of page and map it read/write in app address space</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>copy-on-write fork</p>
<ul>
<li>observation:
xv6 fork copies all pages from parent (see fork())
but fork is often immediately followed by exec</li>
<li>idea: share address space between parent and child
modify fork() to map pages copy-on-write (use extra available system bits in PTEs and PDEs)
on page fault, make copy of page and map it read/write</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>demand paging</p>
<ul>
<li>observation: exec loads the complete file into memory (see exec.c)
expensive: takes time to do so (e.g., file is stored on a slow disk)
unnecessary: maybe not the whole file will be used</li>
<li>idea: load pages from the file on demand
allocate page table entries, but mark them on-demand
on fault, read the page in from the file and update page table entry</li>
<li>challenge: file larger than physical memory (see next idea)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>use virtual memory larger than physical memory</p>
<ul>
<li>observation: application may need more memory than there is physical memory</li>
<li>idea: store less-frequently used parts of the address space on disk
page-in and page-out pages of the address address space transparently</li>
<li>works when working sets fits in physical memory</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>memory-mapped files</p>
<ul>
<li>idea: allow access to files using load and store
can easily read and writes part of a file
e.g., don't have to change offset using lseek system call</li>
<li>page-in pages of a file on demand
when memory is full, page-out pages of a file that are not frequently used</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>shared virtual memory</p>
<ul>
<li>idea: allow processes on different machines to share virtual memory
gives the illusion of physical shared memory, across a network</li>
<li>replicate pages that are only read</li>
<li>invalidate copies on write</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>JOS and virtual memory</p>
<ul>
<li><p>layout: <a href="l-josmem.html">picture</a></p>
</li>
<li><p>UVPT trick (lab 4)
recursively map PD at 0x3BD
  virtual address of PD is (0x3BD&lt;&lt;22)|(0x3BD&lt;&lt;12)
if we want to find pte for virtual page n, compute</p>
<pre><code>pde_t uvpt[n], where uvpt is (0x3BD &lt;&lt; 22) 
= uvpt + n * 4 (because pdt is a word)
= (0xDBD &lt;&lt; 22) | (top 10 bits of n) | (bottom 10 bits of n) &lt;&lt; 2
= 10 | 10 | 12</code></pre>
<p>for example, uvpt[0] is address (0x3BD &lt;&lt; 22), following the pointers gives us
the first entry in the page directory, which points to the first page table, which
we index with 0, which gives us pte 0</p>
<p>simpler(?) than pgdirwalk()</p>
</li>
<li><p>user-level copy-on-write fork (lab4)
JOS propagates page faults to user space
user programs can play similar VM tricks as kernel!
you will do user-level copy-on-write fork
