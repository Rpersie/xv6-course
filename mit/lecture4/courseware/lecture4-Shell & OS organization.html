</p>
<p>Homework solution
==

</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Let's review solution for <a href="../homework/sh.c">sh.c</a></p>
<ul>
<li>exec</li>
<li>redirect</li>
<li>pipe</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>The process graph for a complicated pipeline</p>
<ul>
<li>Who waits for whom? (draw a tree of processes) </li>
<li>Why close read-end and write-end? ensure that every process starts with 3
file descriptors, and that reading from the pipe returns end of file after
the first command exits.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Exploring system calls with more shell features
==

</p>
<ul>
<li><p>You can run the shell, redirect its stdin/stdout, etc.</p>
<ul>
<li>I'll run this shell script with <code>sh &lt; script</code>:<pre><code> echo one
 echo two</code></pre>
</li>
<li><p>What will this shell command do?
<code> $ sh &lt; script &gt; out </code></p>
<ul>
<li><p>the script itself didn't redirect the echo output, but it did inherit a fd
1 that was redirected to out.</p>
</li>
<li><p>to make this work it is important that offset is implicit (maintained by
kernel)</p>
</li>
<li><p>this is why read and write don't take an offset argument</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Is the following the same as above?</p>
<pre><code> $ echo one &gt; out
 $ echo two &gt; out</code></pre>
</li>
<li><p>How to implement sequencing/lists (;,&amp;&amp;,||)</p>
<pre><code>$ gcc x.c ; ./a.out</code></pre>
<pre><code>$ gcc x.c &amp;&amp; ./a.out</code></pre>
</li>
<li><p>How to implement nesting?</p>
<pre><code>$ (echo one; echo two) &gt; out</code></pre>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>How does the shell implement "&amp;"?
<code> $ sleep 2 &amp; </code></p>
<ul>
<li>Q: What if a background process exits while sh waits for a foreground process?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>System call observations
==

</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The fork/exec split looks wasteful; why is it useful? (A: exercise 2)</p>
</li>
<li><p>System call interface simple, just ints and char buffers.  why not have open()
return a pointer reference to a kernel file object?</p>
</li>
<li><p>Linux has a nice representation of a process and its FDs, under /proc/PID/</p>
<ul>
<li>maps: VA range, perms (p=private, s=shared), offset, dev, inode, pathname</li>
<li>fd: symlinks to files pointed to by each fd.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>The file descriptor design:</p>
<ul>
<li>nice interaction with fork</li>
<li>FDs help make programs more general purpose: don't need special cases for
files vs console vs pipe</li>
<li>shell pipelines only work for programs w/ common formats (lines of text)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>OS organization
==

</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Now we have a feel for what Unix system call interface provides, how to implement the interface?</p>
</li>
<li><p>Why have an o/s at all?  why not just a library?
then apps are free to use it, or not -- flexible
apps can directly interact with hardware
some tiny O/Ss for embedded processors work this way</p>
</li>
<li><p>Key requirement:
isolation
multiplexing
interaction</p>
</li>
<li><p>helpful approach: abstract machine resources rather than raw hardware
File system, not raw disk
TCP, not a raw ethernet
Processes, not raw CPU/memory
abstractions often ease multiplexing and interaction
also more convenient and portable</p>
</li>
<li><p>Goals:
apps must use OS interface, cannot directly interact with hardware
apps cannot harm operating system</p>
</li>
<li><p>Hardware support for isolation</p>
<ul>
<li>Processors support user mode and kernel mode<ul>
<li>some instructions can only be executed in kernel mode
  e.g., instructions to directly interact with hardware</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If an application executes a privileged instruction hardware doesn't allow it<ul>
<li>instead switches to kernel mode</li>
<li>kernel can clean up</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Leverage hardware support</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Operating systems runs in kernel mode</p>
<ul>
<li>kernel is a big program
services: processes, file system, net
low-level: devices, virtual memory
all of kernel runs with full hardware privilege (convenient)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Applications run in user mode</p>
<ul>
<li>isolated from kernel</li>
<li>systems calls switch between user and kernel mode
application call instructions to enter kernel
instruction enters kernel at an entry point specified by kernel</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>What to run in kernel mode?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>xv6 follows a traditional design: all of the OS runs in kernel mode</p>
<ul>
<li>this design is called a monolithic kernel</li>
<li>kernel interface ~= system call interface</li>
<li>good: easy for subsystems to cooperate
one cache shared by file system and virtual memory</li>
<li>bad: interactions are complex
leads to bugs
no isolation within kernel</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>alternative: microkernel design</p>
<ul>
<li>many OS services run as ordinary user programs
file system in a file server</li>
<li>kernel implements minimal mechanism to run services in user space
IPC
virtual memory
threads</li>
<li>kernel interface != system call interface        </li>
<li>good: more isolation</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>jos: doesn't abstract hardware resources, but still provide isolation</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Can one have process isolation WITHOUT h/w-supported kernel/user mode?
yes!
see Singularity O/S, later in semester
but h/w user/kernel mode is the most popular plan</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>xv6 kernel address space
==

</p>
<ul>
<li><p>boundary between apps and kernel
 kernel/user bit
 kernel address space
 ...</p>
</li>
<li><p>start w. kernel address space
machine has booted
code runs without virtual memory
set up up kernel address space
walk through kvmalloc()</p>
</li>
</ul>
