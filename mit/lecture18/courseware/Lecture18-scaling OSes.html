<body><p>6.828 2014 Lec 18: scaling OSes
==

</p>
<p>Plan
 Scaling OSes
 Concurrent hash tables
 Reference counters
 RadixVM
 Scalability commutativity rule

</p>
<p>Scaling kernels
--

</p>
<p>Goal: scale with many cores
  Many applications rely heavily on OS
    file system, network stack, etc.
  If OS isn't parallel, then apps won't scale
  ==&gt; Execute systems calls in parallel 

</p>
<p>Problem: sharing
  OS maintains many shared data structures
    proc table
    buffer cache
    scheduler queue
    etc.
  They protected by locks to maintain invariants
  Application may contend on the locks
  Limits scalability


</p>
<p>OS evolution for scaling
  Early versions of UNIX big kernel lock
  Fine-grained locking and per-core data structures
  Lock-free data structures
  Today: case study of scaling VM subsystem

</p>
<p>Example: process queue
  One shared queue
  Every time slice, each core invokes scheduler()
  scheduler() locks scheduling queue
  If N is large, invocations of scheduler() may contend
  Contention can result in dramatic performance collapse
    Scalable locks avoid collapse
    But still limits nuber of scheduler() invocations per sec.

</p>
<p>Observation: sharing is unintended
  The threads are <em>not</em> sharing
     N cores, N threads
     Can run each thread on its own core
   Can we void sharing when apps are not sharing?

</p>
<p>One idea: avoiding sharing in common case
   Each core maintains its own queue
   scheduler() manipulates its own queue
   No sharing -&gt; no contention

</p>
<p>Extreme version: share nothing (e.g., Barrelfish)
   Run an independent kernel on each core
   Treat the shared-memory machine as a distributed systems
     Maybe even no cache-coherent shared memory
   Downside: no balancing
     If one 1 cores has N threads, and other cores have none
   Someone must worry about sharing
     Kernel, app, or user-level scheduler
     Use distributed-systems techniques

</p>
<p>Today's focus: use shared-memory wisely
  Computer has shared memory and OS has shared data structures
  Arrange that kernel doesn't introduce sharing in the common case
    Keep per-core data structure (scheduling queue per core)
    Load-balance only when a queue is empty
  Tricky when we want sharing 
    Want shared buffer cache
    Want shared physical pages
    Some structures work well for sharing without unintended sharing
       E.g., hash tables.
    Others are challenging
       E.g., reference counts

</p>
<p>Concurrent hash tables
--

</p>
<p>Hash tables
  Used for shared caches (name cache, buffer cache)
    map block# to block
  Implementations
    one lock per hash table (bad scaling)
      lots of unintended sharing
    one lock per bucket (better scaling)
      blocks that map to same buck share unintendedly
    lock-free lists per bucket (see below)
      little unintended sharing
      case: search with on list, while someone is removing

</p>
<p>Lock-free bucket
</p>
<pre><code>```
struct element {
  int key;
  int value;
  struct element *next;
};

struct element *bucket;

void push(struct element *e) {
    again:
        e-&gt;next = bucket;
        if (cmpxchg(&amp;bucket, e-&gt;next, e) != e-&gt;next)
            goto again;
}

struct element *pop(void) {
    again:
        struct element *e = bucket;
        if (cmpxchg(&amp;bucket, e, e-&gt;next) != e)
            goto again;
        return e;
 }
```
No changes to search
More complicated to remove from middle, but can be done</code></pre>
<p>Challenge: Memory reuse (ABA problem)
  stack contains three elements
    top -&gt; A -&gt; B -&gt; C
  CPU 1 about to pop off the top of the stack,
    preempted just before cmpxchg(&amp;top, A, B)
  CPU 2 pops off A, B, frees both of them
    top -&gt; C
  CPU 2 allocates another item (malloc reuses A) and pushes onto stack
    top -&gt; A -&gt; C
  CPU 1: cmpxchg succeeds, stack now looks like
    top -&gt; B -&gt; C
  this is called the "ABA problem"<br>   (memory switches from A-state to B-state and back to A-state without being able to tell)

</p>
<p>Solution: delay freeing until safe
   E.g., Arrange time in epochs
   Free when all processors have left previous


</p>
<p>Reference counters
--

</p>
<p>Challenge: involves true sharing
  Many resources in kernel are reference counted
  Often a scaling bottleneck (once unintended sharing is removed)

</p>
<p>Reference counter
  Design 1: inc, dec+iszero in lock/unlock
    content on cache-line for lock
  Design 2: atomic increment/decrement
    content on cache-line for refcnt
  Design 3: per-core counters
    inc/dec: apply op to per-core value
    iszero: add up all per-core values and check for zero
      need per-core locks for each counter
    space overhead is # counters * # cores

</p>
<p>Refcache
  An object has a shared reference count
  Per-core cache of deltas
    inc/dec compute a per-core delta
    iszero(): applies all deltas to global reference counter
  If global counter drops to zero, it stays zero
  Space
    Uncontended reference counters will be evicted from cache
    Only cores that use counter have delta

</p>
<p>Challenge: determining if counter is zero
  Don't want to call iszero() on-demand
    it must contact all cores
  Idea: compute iszero() periodically
    divide time into epochs (~10 msec)
    at end of an epoch core flushes deltas to global counter
    if global counter drops to zero, put on review queue for 2 epochs later
      if no core has it on its review queue
    2 epochs later: if global counter is still zero, free object
    why wait 2 epochs?
  See example in paper in Figure 1
  More complications to support weak references

</p>
<p>Epoch maintainance
  global epoch = min(per-core epochs)
  each core periodically increase per-core epoch
    each 10 msec call flush()+review()
  one core periodically compute global epoch

</p>
<p>RadixVM
--

</p>
<p>Case study of avoiding unintended sharing
 VM system (ops: map, unmap, page fault)
 Challenges:
   reference counters
   semantics of VM operations
   when unmap returns page must be unmapped at all cores

</p>
<p>Goal: no intended sharing for VM ops
  Ops on different memory regions
  No cache-line transfer when no sharing
  Ok to have sharing when memory regions overlap
    That is intended sharing

</p>
<p>What data structures do we need to maintain?
  Some information per hardware page (e.g., ppinfo array in jos)
  Modern OSes don't use an array like jos (too expensive in terms of memory)
  Modern OSes use a balanced tree
    Lock-free balanced trees are tricky
    Unintended sharing (see figure 6)

</p>
<p>Solution: radix tree
  Behaves like hardware page tables
  Disjoint lookups/inserts will access disjoint parts of the tree (see figure 7)
    stores a separate copy of the mapping metadata for each page
    metadata also stores pointers to physical memory page
  Folds repeated entries (unlike jos array)
  No range queries
  Freeing nodes in tree using refcache

</p>
<p>TLB shootdown
  Unmap requires that no core has the page mapped before returning
  The core running the unmap must send TLB shootdowns to the cores that have the page in their TLB
  Which cores do have the page in their TLB?
    Easy to determine if the processor has a software-filled TLB
    At a TLB misses the kernel can record the core # for the page
    x86 has a hardware-filled TLB
  Solution: per-core page tables
    The paging hardware will set the accesses bit only in the per-core page table

</p>
<p>Maps/unmaps for overlapping region
  simple: locks enforce ordering of concurrent map/unmap on overlapping regions
    acquire locks, going left to right
  page-fault also takes a lock

</p>
<p>Implementation
  sv6 (C++ version of xv6)

</p>
<p>Eval
  Metis and microbenchmarks

</p>
<p>Avoiding unintentionial sharing
--

</p>
<p>Scalable commutativity rule
  rule: if two operations, commute then there is a scalable (conflict-free) implementation 
  non-overlapping map/unmap are example of a general rule
  intuition:
    if ops commute, order doesn't matter
    communication between ops must be unnecessary
