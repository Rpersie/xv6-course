<body><p>6.828 2014 Lecture 10: Processes, threads, and scheduling
=

</p>
<p>Plan:
  homework
  process
  threads
  scheduling

</p>
<h1>Homework</h1>
<p>iderw():
  what goes wrong with adding sti/cli in iderw?
  what ensures atomicity between processors
  what ensures atomicity within a single processor?

</p>
<p>filealloc():
  Q: could the disk interrupt handler run while interrupts are enabled?
  Q: does any any interrupt handler grab the ftable.lock?
  Q: what interrupt could cause trouble?
  Q: timer interrupt?
    maybe we will find out in this lecture

</p>
<h2>Process</h2>
<p>Process
 motivated by isolation

</p>
<p> idea: an abstract virtual machine provides the illusion to application of a
 dedicated computer but an abstract one convenient for application developer one
 process cannot effect another accidentally



</p>
<p>Process API:
  fork
  exec
  exit
  wait
  kill
  sbrk
  getpid

</p>
<p>Challenge: more processes than processors
  xv6 picture:
    1 user thread and 1 kernel thread per process
    1 scheduler thread per processor
    n processors

</p>
<p>Terms
  a process: address space plus one or more threads
  a thread: thread of execution
  kernel thread: thread running in kernel mode
  user thread: thread running in user mode

</p>
<h1>Thread</h1>
<p>Thread of execution: 
  an abstraction that contains enough state of a running program that it can be stopped and resumed
  xv6 API: yield, swtch

</p>
<p>Goals for solution:
  Switching transparent to user threads
  User thread cannot hog a processor  (kernel thread assumed to be correct, so not a goal)

</p>
<p>Overview of switch between two user threads
  user threads
    User -&gt; kernel transition
    kernel -&gt; kernel switch
    kernel -&gt; User transition
 guaranteed U-&gt;K transitions
    timing interrupt every 100 ms
    switches to different kernel thread on yield
    the different kernel thread returns to a different user thread

</p>
<p>Challenges in implementing:
  Opaque code ("You are not supposed to understand this")
  Concurrency  (several processors switching between threads)
  Terminating a thread, always need a valid stack

</p>
<h1>Xv6 design</h1>
<p>One scheduler thread per processor
  Simplifies implementation:
    Need a stack to run scheduler on, if there are no other threads anymore
  Downside: more switches
    To switch from one thread to another requires two switches
    thread 1 -&gt; scheduler -&gt; thread 2
  Advantage: scheduling organized as co-routines
    Simplifies reasoning about concurrency
    E.g., it is clear lock is always passed from current thread to scheduler thread

</p>
<p>xv6 schedules user threads preemptively
  Every 100ms a timer interrupt

</p>
<p>xv6 schedules kernel threads cooperatively
  Assume kernel programmer doesn't make mistakes (e.g., no infinite loop)

</p>
<h1>Code</h1>
<p>Forced switching:
  demo of two processes who don't invoke system calls
    look at process states
  proc.h
  clock interrupt
    lapic.c for SMP
    timer.c for uniprocessor
  walk through what xv6 does to guarantee switching
    breakpoint in trap at yield() (b: trap.c:136)
    get hog running (c 100)
    look at tf, in particular tf-&gt;eip
      interrupt arrived in user space, while running hog
    look at tf-&gt;trapno (timer interrupt), gets to yield
    get to swtch, look at contexts (p /x *cpus[0]-&gt;scheduler)
      Q: why should ncli be 1?
    look at eip before return from swtch  (we switched to scheduler thread)
    scheduler: switches to selected thread (set b proc.c:288)
    will return user space

</p>
<p>What is the scheduling policy? 
  will the thread that called yield run immediately again?

</p>
<p>Concurrency
  plock held across swtch; why?
   yield(): p is set to runnable, p must complete switch before another scheduler choses p
  hard to reason about; coroutine style helps
   always enter and leave a thread at the same instruction
  can two schedulers select the same runnable process?
  why does scheduler release after loop, and re-acquire it immediately?
   To give other processors a chance to look at the proc table
  why does the scheduler enable interrupts?
   The scheduler maybe the only runnable thread
     All other threads maybe sleeping (e.g., waiting on I/O input)
   To briefly run the processor with interrupts enabled
     An interrupt may wakeup a sleeping thread


</p>
<p>Thread clean up
  let's look at kill()
    can we clean up killed process?  (no: it might be running, holding locks, etc.)
    before returning to user space: process kills itself by calling exit
  let's look at exit()
    can thread delete its stack?
      no: it has to switch off it!
    wait() does the cleanup
