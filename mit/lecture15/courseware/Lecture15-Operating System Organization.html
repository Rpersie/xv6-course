=

</p>
<p>Operating System Organization
  students have completed building an exokernel in lab3 and lab4
  user-space fork (copy-on-write)
  sophisticated VM handling in libos
  assumption in this lecture: one cannot change the kernel

</p>
<p>Plan: OS organization
  goals for a kernel interface
  monolithic
  microkernel
  exokernel
  little data, much opinion

</p>
<p>OS organization
--

</p>
<p>Goals for kernel
  Apps can use hardware resources
  Apps are easy convenient to write
  Apps are multiplexed (isolation and sharing)
  Few kernel crashes
  Kernel can evolve

</p>
<p>OS design
  lots of ways to structure an OS -- how to decide?
    what is the right kernel API?
    assumption: you cannot change the API radically
    =&gt; the point of a view in this lec: the app developer
  looking for principles and approaches

</p>
<p>Traditional approach (Linux, xv6)
  kernel API ~ POSIX
  virtualize some resources: cpu and memory
    simulate a dedicated cpu and memory system for each app
    why? it's a simple model for app programmers
  abstract others: storage, network, IPC
    layer a sharable abstraction over h/w (file system, IP/TCP)

</p>
<p>Example: virtualize the cpu
  goal: simulate a dedicated cpu for each process
    we want transparent CPU multiplexing
    process need not think about how it interacts w/ other processes
  OS runs different processes in turn, via clock interrupt
    clock means process doesn't need to do anything special to switch
    also prevents hogging
  how to achieve transparency?
    OS saves state, then restores
  what does OS save?
    eight regs, EIP, seg regs, eflags, page table base ptr
  where does OS save it?
    OS keeps per-process table of saved states
  the return from clock interrupt restores a <em>different</em> process's state
  the point: process doesn't have to worry about multiplexing!
  this is the traditioal approach to virtualizing the CPU
    what does the exokernel/JOS do?

</p>
<p>Example: virtualize memory
  idea: simulate a complete memory system for each process
    so process has complete freedom how it uses that memory
    doesn't have to worry about other processes
    so addresses 0..2^32 all work, but refer to private memory
    convenient: all programs can start at zero
      and memory looks contiguous, good for large arrays &amp;c
    safe: can't even <em>name</em> another process's memory
  again: traditional but we'll soon see it's a limiting approach
    really want apps to have more control than this style of VM implies

</p>
<p>Level of indirection allows OS to play other tricks
  demand paging:
    process bigger than available physical memory?
    "page-out" (write) pages to disk, mark PTEs invalid
    if process tries to use one of those pages, MMU causes page fault
      kern finds phys mem, page-in from disk, mark PTE valid
    this works because apps use only a fraction of mem at a given time
    need h/w valid flag, page faults, and re-startable instructions
  copy-on-write:
    avoid copy implied by fork() -- won't be needed if exec()
    make parent and child share the physical memory pages
    if either writes, do the copy then
    so need per-page write-protect flag
    both of above are transparent to application
      still thinks it has simple dedicated memory from 0..2^32
  paging h/w has turned out to be one of the most fruitful ideas in OS
    you have been using it a lot in labs
  can we make it safe for apps to play these tricks?

</p>
<p>Monolithic
--

</p>
<p>Traditional organization: monolithic OS (e.g., xv6)
  h/w, kernel, user
    kernel is a big program: process ctl, vm, fs, network
    all of kernel runs w/ full hardware privilege (very convenient)
  good: easy for sub-systems to cooperate (e.g. paging and file system)
  bad: interactions =&gt; complex, bugs are easy, no isolation within OS
  extensibility: dynamically-loadable modules, wait for next kernel release
  philosophy: convenience (for app or OS programmer)
    for any problem, either hide it from app, or add a new system call
    (we need philosophy because there is not much science here)
    may take a while for the new system call is added
  very successful approach (e.g., Linux)

</p>
<p>Microkernel
--

</p>
<p>Alternate organization: microkernel
  philosophy: IPC and user-space servers
    for any problem, make a new server, talk to it w/ RPC
  h/w, kernel, server processes, apps
  servers: VM, FS, TCP/IP, Print, Display
  split up kernel sub-systems into server processes
    some servers have privileged access to some h/w (e.g. FS and disks)
  apps talk to them via IPC / RPC
  kernel's main job: fast IPC
  good: simple/efficient kernel, sub-systems isolated, enforced better modularity
  bad: cross-sub-system optimization harder, lots of IPCs may be slow
  extensibility: can replace servers
  in the end, lots of good individual ideas, but overall plan didn't catch on for desktops/servers
  but success in embedded space
  More next lecture

</p>
<p>Exokernel
--

</p>
<p>Alternate organization: exokernel  (JOS)
  philosophy: eliminate all abstractions
    for any problem, expose h/w or info to app, let app do what it wants
  h/w, kernel, environments, libOS, app
  an exokernel would not provide address space, virtual cpu, file system, TCP
  instead, give control to app:
    phys pages, addr mappings, clock interrupts, disk i/o, net i/o
    let app build nice address space if it wants, or not
    should give aggressive apps much more flexibility
  challenges:
    how to multiplex cpu/mem/&amp;c if you expose directly to apps?
    how to get security/isolation despite apps having low-level control?
    how to multiplex w/o understanding: disk (file system), incoming tcp pkts

</p>
<p>Exokernel example: memory
  what are the resources? (phys pages, mappings)
  what does an app need to ask the kernel to do?
    pa = AllocPage()
    DeallocPage(pa)
    TLBwr(va, pa)
  and these kernel-&gt;app upcalls:
    PageFault(va)
    PleaseReleaseAPage()
  what does OS need to do to make multiplexing work?
    ensure app only creates mappings to phys pages it owns
    track what env owns what phys pages
    decide which app to ask to give up a phys page when system runs out
      that app gets to decide which of its pages

</p>
<p>Simple example: shared memory
  two processes want to share memory, for fast interaction
    note traditional "virtual address space" doesn't allow for this
  process a: pa = AllocPage()
             put 0x5000 -&gt; pa in private table
             PageFault(0x5000) upcall -&gt; TLBwr(0x5000, pa)
             give pa to process b (need to tell exokernel...)
  process b:
             put 0x6000 -&gt; pa in private table
             ...

</p>
<p>Example cool thing you could do w/ exokernel-style memory
  databases like to keep a cache of disk pages in memory
  problem on traditional OS:
    assume an OS with demand-paging to/from disk
    if DB caches some disk data, and OS needs a phys page,
      OS may page-out a DB page holding a cached disk block
    but that's a waste of time: if DB knew, it could release phys
      page w/o writing, and later read it back from DB file (not paging area)
  1. exokernel needs phys mem for some other app
  2. exokernel sends DB a PleaseReleaseAPage() upcall
  3. DB picks a clean page, calls DeallocPage(pa)
  4. OR DB picks dirty page, writes to disk, then DeallocPage(pa)

</p>
<p>Exokernel example: cpu
  what does it mean to expose cpu to app?
    kernel tells app when it is taking away cpu
    kernel tells app when it gives cpu to app
  so if app is running and timer interrupt causes end of slice
    cpu jumps from app into kernel
    kernel jumps back into app at "please yield" upcall
    app saves state (registers, EIP, &amp;c)
    app calls Yield()
  when kernel decides to resume app
    kernel jumps into app at "resume" upcall
    app restores those saved registers and EIP

</p>
<p>What cool things could an app do w/ exokernel-style cpu management?
  suppose time slice ends in the middle of
    acquire(lock);
    ...
    release(lock);
  you don't want the app to be holding the lock the whole time!
    then maybe other apps can't make forward progress
  so the "please yield" upcall can first complete the critical section

</p>
<p>Fast RPC with direct cpu management
  how does traditional OS let apps communicate?
    pipes (or sockets)
    picture: buffer in kernel, lots of copying and system calls
    RPC probably takes 8 kernel/user crossings (read()s and write()s)
  how does exokernel help?
    Yield() can take a target process argument
      almost a direct jump to an instruction in target process
      kernel allows only entries at approved locations in target
    kernel leaves regs alone, so can contain arguments
      (in constrast to traditional restore of target's registers)
    target app uses Yield() to return
    so only 4 crossings

</p>
<p>Debate: monolithic versus microkernel
  Get OS developers very excited
  Practical view:
    If you have a working monolithic kernel, why change?
      Adding features that users want
      Isolate new features, if possible
    If you start from scratch, why not use microkernel?
  Today: systems are not purely one or the other design
    Linux is monolithic but has servers
    Linux API also gives apps a lot of control
      map/unmap, pgfault
      kernel extensions
